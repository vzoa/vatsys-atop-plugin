### Development Environment Setup

This project uses .NET Framework 4.8, so you will need to have the SDK installed. Additionally, you will need vatSys to
be installed.

The project requires `vatSys.exe` as a reference. You can do this by adding the `bin` folder of your vatSys install to
the reference paths setup within your IDE (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\vatSys\bin\`).
